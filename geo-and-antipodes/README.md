# Geo and Antipodes

Based on the app _The Other Side of The World_ from this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-pro-course/ by **Ardit Sulce**, with my changes.

**My changes:**
- using a different library: PyOWM https://pypi.org/project/pyowm/,
- changes to the code resulting from using a different library,
- small changes to the command line app,
- change of the purpose and functionality of the app: my version shows the weather and time in a place located on the other side of the world, then shows current time and weather in the place that the user has provided,
- adding environmental variables.
