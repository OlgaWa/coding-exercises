# Cinema Booking

Based on the app _Cinema Booking App_ from this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-pro-course/ by **Ardit Sulce**, with my changes.

**My changes:**
- using a different database management system: MySQL,
- creating my own database instead of using a database provided by the instructor,
- creating two databases ("cinema" and "banking") and the tables based on the files provided by the instructor,
- small changes to the front-end of the app and to the PDF file,
- adding environmental variables,
- changes to the code resulting from using a different database.
